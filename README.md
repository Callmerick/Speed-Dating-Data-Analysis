# Speed-Dating-Data-Analysis
Speed Dating Data Analysis is my Capstone project for my Data Science minor. This project aims to explore how race and gender affect in speed dating environment in the US. I was planning to adopt machine learning strategies to look for patterns. However, this dataset does not include a significant amount of data entries. Thus, I started to use standard statistics and found a statistically significant result. In the file, I included my presentation slide and my Jupyter notebook.
